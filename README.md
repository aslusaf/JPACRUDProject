### JPACRUDProject

#### Description:
This is a full-stack CRUD project that allows the a user to access information about airports all across the United States. In addition to searching for airports, users can also add their own airports, as well as update and/or delete existing airport records.

#### Information:
The website includes a navigation bar at the top with the ability to return to the homepage from any other page by clicking on the top-left icon. The navigation bar also includes a search feature that provides a broad query search of the entire database of airports based on the user entered text.

#### Lessons learned:
I didn't have any specific issues on this project. The front end styling with Bootstrap was a learning process and involved a bit of trial and error. I found both JPA and MySQL to be very intuitive. This project was very rewarding. Creating a fully-functional and semi-practical full-stack website by myself in only 2 days shows just how far I've come since "HelloWorld".
